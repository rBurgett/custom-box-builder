custom-box-builder
==================

This is a browser-based application for creating custom shipping boxes. My day job includes shipping and receiving and this is a utility that I have been needing for a while. Simply enter the dimensions of the object to be shipped and it will tell you how to cut and construct a custom box to ship it with. This is still in production. It is not a working product... YET!
